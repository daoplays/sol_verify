# sol_verify
Solana program that handles verifying programs on chain with code in a git repo
The program is currently in early-access mode and a front end can be found at daoplays.org/verified

To do:
    
1) Add support for security.txt to the program creators to specify the source location there, rather than having to enter it in the GUI.  Make this override anything entered into the GUI to stop people copying a git repo and then claiming credit for a particular program.

2) Add support for non git based code repositories

3) Integrate into explorers
